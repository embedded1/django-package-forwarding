<h2>Package forwarding platform for Django</h2>

USendHome is an advanced cloud based platform for international shipping of parcels from the US anywhere in the world.
it enables online shoppers around the world to manage and ship their purchases in a super simple and affordable way.

<strong font-size="14">What was started as a side project to get my hands dirty after self studied the WEB domain became a fully working platform that processed thousands of packages.</strong>

I designed, coded and operated the platform with the help of freelancers along the way mainly for customer support and design.
The code was built on top of the great <a href="https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar" target="_blank">django-oscar</a> library.

• Used Python + Django + Nginx + Gunicorn on the server side

• Used Javascript + Jquery + Twitter Bootstrap + HTML5 + CSS3 on the client side

• Extensively used Celery to run multiple HTTP requests in parallel to reduce server load time and to receive shipping methods from multiple carriers in time.

• Involved in business development, marketing and hiring freelancers.

• Integrated external APIs such as: PayPal, Bitcoin processor, Mixpanel, Easypost, Amazon Product API.

• Developed Chrome extension and Shopify app to provide greater value to our users and to drive in users from multiple channels.

• Configured and deployed the platform in the cloud, used Cron tasks to run background processes and GIT to manage the source code.
