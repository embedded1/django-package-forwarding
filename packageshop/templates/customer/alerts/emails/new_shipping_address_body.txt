        Hello {{ name }},
        We have exciting news for you!! We've successfully completed the distribution facility migration
        process and now your packages have a new US shipping address.
        We performed this transition to carry out our day to day efforts to cut down on shipping costs,
        increase speed and efficiencies and lastly, provide you with a wide range of shipping carriers for your online orders.

        Your account has already been updated with your own new US shipping address.
        Please use this address for all new orders.
        We've got you covered in case you have packages in transit addressed to your previous private mailbox or already
        stored in our New Jersey facility.
        We will add all packages addressed to your previous mailbox into your account and you could
        release them for delivery as well.

        It is important to note that we can only complete a Package Consolidation request if ALL packages are
        stored in the same facility. So, if you're waiting for more items to arrive you must use your old shipping address
        to gather all items in the same facility.

        In addition, we're about to launch new shipping services (including Express) shortly so stay tuned and keep on shopping.
