        August 20 2016. You can read the full agreements on our updated Terms of Service page at the URL below:
        {{ site }}{{ terms_url }}.
        Here are the highlights of updates:

    {% blocktrans %}
        We have added a new paragraph that describes the terms that apply on your
        local US address provided by USendHome.
    {% endblocktrans %}

    {% blocktrans %}
        If you continue using the Site after August 20 2016, the new terms will apply to you.
        If you don’t agree to the amended Terms of Service, you can close your account before August 20 2016,
        and you won’t be bound by the amended terms.
