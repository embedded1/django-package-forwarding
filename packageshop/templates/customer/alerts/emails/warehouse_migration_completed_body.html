        USendHome is in a process of moving to a new and larger facility that can safely store the huge number of
        packages we receive each day.
        The new facility is equipped with a state-of-the-art logistics services which will speed up
        the package processing and dispatching operations.
        We performed this transition to carry out our day to day efforts to cut down on international shipping costs,
        increase speed and efficiency and lastly, provide you with a wide range of shipping carriers for your online orders.

        Your account has already been updated with the new shipping address.
        Please use this address for all new orders you send to our warehouse.
        We've got you covered in case you have packages already in transit addressed to your previous address -
        All those packages will also be available in your control panel as well.

        We'll email you as soon as your personal US address at the new facility is ready to receive your goods.<br/>
        <strong>In the meanwhile please don't deliver new orders to our current facility in NJ as we won't be able to process them.</strong>
