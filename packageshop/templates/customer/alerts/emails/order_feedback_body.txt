        We really hope you're happy with your new items. But there's only one way to find out for sure -
        and that's to ask for your feedback.

        If you have a few moments, we'd be really grateful if you could answer 3 very quick questions
        about your experience with us, so that we can keep improving the USendHome experience for everyone.
