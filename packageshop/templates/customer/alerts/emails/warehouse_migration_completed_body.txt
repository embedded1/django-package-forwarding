        Hello {{ name }},
        USendHome is in a process of moving to a new and larger facility that can safely store the huge number of
        packages we receive each day.
        The new facility is equipped with a state-of-the-art logistics services which will speed up

        Your account has already been updated with the new shipping address.
        Please use this address for all new orders you send to our warehouse.
        We've got you covered in case you have packages already in transit addressed to your previous address -
        All those packages will also be available in your control panel as well.
