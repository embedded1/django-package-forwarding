	We just received a delivery from {{ shop_name }} that was missing your private mailbox number.
	Shipments lacking this information make it harder to identify the proper recipient and delay processing your package.
	Your package will be available in your account once we complete the extra processing required for such packages.

{% blocktrans with uuid=package.owner.get_profile.uuid %}
	Please make sure that you always include your private mailbox number {{ uuid }} on the
	shipping address of your orders when using our services to have your package updated in your account
    immediately with no delays.

         We did not charge you this time, but in the future, if a shipment does not identify your private mailbox number,
		a missing mailbox number surcharge will be applied.
