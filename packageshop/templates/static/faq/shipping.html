                Shipping batteries regulations have changed dramatically in 2017 and now determining whether a carrier and/or the destination country will accept the package will hinge in most cases on the type of battery (e.g. lithium ion, lithium metal, etc.),
                the total battery weight, and any specific rules or regulations applied by customs in the recipientâ€™s country.

            Due to regulations by the IATA, FAA and the TSA, <strong>USendHome no longer will be able to ship loose Lithium Ion batteries (PI965) for our customers.</strong>
            This includes spare cell phone, and Laptop batteries, as well as power banks, and mobile chargers.

                Some countries allow goods below specific values to be imported free from duty and/or taxes.

                and taxes that may apply for items that are valued above that amount.

                If an item is described incorrectly or an inaccurate value is stated, customs authorities may impose penalties and, in serious cases,

                First class international is untrackable.
                Once itâ€™s been sent itâ€™s out of our control.
                There is no way to track it and there is no proof of delivery or shipment.
                It also doesn't have expedited brokerage, which means packages can "sit in customs" for up to 4-6 weeks.
                Although this is rare it does happen.
                Packages are sometimes not delivered at all (1% of cases), so this is why insurance is automatically added to your order,
                However, it is generally fairly dependable, arriving with a week or two 95% of the time.
                Lost package claims may be filed between 45 and 90 days after shipment.
